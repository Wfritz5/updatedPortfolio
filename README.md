This is my updated portfolio where I was able to use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to build a beautiful website.
This website has my portfolio, where all images are links to the actual demo itself and there are also links to the Github Repo.
I listed my skills and at the bottom of the page is contact information where I used Font Awesome Icons as links for any of the social media platforms that an employer
may need.
